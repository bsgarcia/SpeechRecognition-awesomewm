##Custom Personal assistant for GNU/Linux

GNU/Linux systems are missing personals assistants, therefore I decided to create my own by agregating 2 technologies: 

* Google's speech recognition api
* Snowboy hotword detection

#Dependencies
* sox
* gtts
* Pyaudio
* numpy
* mplayer/mpv
* notify-send

The code is messy and ugly as hell, but functional.
Some functionalites can be seen in the demo below.
