#My Personal assistant for GNU/Linux

GNU/Linux systems are missing personals assistants, therefore I decided to create my own by aggregating 2 technologies: 

* Google's speech recognition api
* Snowboy hotword detection

The program is integrated in my window manager status bar, as a widget. 
The code is messy and ugly as hell, but functional.
Some functionalites can be seen in the demo below.  

##Dependencies
* sox
* gtts
* Pyaudio
* numpy
* mplayer/mpv
* notify-send
